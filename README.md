# Python lessons
A repo that will hold python lessons as I develop them.  Starting very basic.

## Setting up python and jupyter notebooks
Here's some steps to help you get set up to run the notebooks in this repository.

### 1) Download the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda open data science platform</a>.
I definitely recommend you download this if you plan to use Python in a Data Science capacity (or basically any other capacity).  It will give you everything you need to get up and running, including the notebook environment.

### 2) Download or fork this repository
You should see a little "download" button or "fork" button at the top of this repository.  Downloading it is like anything else, you can save it to a directory on your computer.  Forking it will make a copy of it in your git account's repositories and what you do from there may require a little <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world">light reading</a>

### 3) Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory with these notebooks in it

### 4) Type "jupyter notebook" in the terminal.  A browser window should pop up showing a list of files (including these notebooks).
